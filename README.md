# Exploration Dungeon Crawler

This project is an attempt to create an exploration-based game with an interface similar to old dungeon crawlers. I do not have the skills to make an exploration game in 2D or 3D, and the somewhat restricted perspective of the dungeon crawler would make exploration interesting if done properly.

<h2>How to play</h2>
The goal of the game is to light all of the torches in the map (there are currently 12). Players navigate around the map with the buttons at the bottom of the screen, using the lantern and the compass.


- Once players find a torch, they can use the lantern by clicking on the 'Lantern' button to light the torch. Once a torch is lit, the player can use the lantern again on a tile with a torch to relight the lantern.
- Anywhere else, the player can use the lantern to check how much light is left in the lantern (in other words, how many times the player can move - not including turns - before the lantern runs out.)
- If the lantern runs out of light, the player will be unable to see anything and can only see again if they can find a lit torch to light their lantern.
- The compass is also extremely useful for navigating around the map.
