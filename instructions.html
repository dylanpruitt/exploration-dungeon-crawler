      The goal of the game is to light all of the torches in the map (there are
      currently 15). Players navigate around the map with the buttons at the
      bottom of the screen, with the help of various items.
    </p>
    <ul id="instructions">
      <li>
        Once players find a torch, they can use the lantern by clicking on the
        'Lantern' button to light the torch. Once a torch is lit, the player can
        use the lantern again on a tile with a torch to relight the lantern.
      </li>
      <li>
        Anywhere else, the player can use the lantern to check how much light is
        left in the lantern (in other words, how many times the player can move
        - not including turns - before the lantern runs out.)
      </li>
      <li>
        If the lantern runs out of light, the player will be unable to see
        anything and can only see again if they can find a lit torch to light
        their lantern.
        <em>You cannot light your lantern again at an unlit torch.</em>
      </li>
